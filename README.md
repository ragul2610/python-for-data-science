                                        Python Libraries for Data Science
"Master the utilization of Python libraries for data science, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, to efficiently manipulate, analyze, visualize.
Develop proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques, and apply them to real-world datasets
for data-driven decision-making and insights."

This objective emphasizes the mastery of essential Python libraries for data science and the practical application of data analysis and machine learning techniques on real datasets,
which are crucial skills for data science professionals.The ability to slice and dice data and present the results using visual analytics is taken a step forward by incorporating
the descriptive statistical techniques for measures of central tendency and dispersion.
